# think-skills

[中文](README.CN.md)

`hong-skills` is a personal collection of AI agent skills distilled from everyday work and life. The name `hong` is inspired by macro commands: a powerful yet easy-to-use shortcut pattern for reusable capability, while also carrying a sense of breadth and ambition.

The README is the repository index. Detailed notes for each skill live in [`docs/`](docs/).

## Current Skills

| Skill | Category | Use When | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `think-router` | Skill router | You are unsure which skill in this repository fits the current problem. | [`docs/think-router.md`](docs/think-router.md) |
| `critical-thinking` | Thinking / argument evaluation | You need to examine a view, claim, argument, decision, or phenomenon by checking reasons, evidence, assumptions, bias, and alternatives. | [`docs/critical-thinking.md`](docs/critical-thinking.md) |
| `beautiful-question` | Thinking / problem solving | A problem is vague, shallow, or stuck at the symptom level, and you need to find the real question before solving it. | [`docs/beautiful-question.md`](docs/beautiful-question.md) |
| `first-principle` | Thinking / innovation | You need to strip away inherited assumptions, find the system's base premise, and rebuild from first principles. | [`docs/first-principle.md`](docs/first-principle.md) |
| `deepthink-5so` | Thinking / consequence inference | You need to repeatedly ask "so what?" to infer what a phenomenon may eventually lead to. | [`docs/deepthink-5so.md`](docs/deepthink-5so.md) |
| `system-thinking` | Thinking / systems analysis | You need to map variables, causal chains, feedback loops, delays, and stakeholders in a complex system. | [`docs/system-thinking.md`](docs/system-thinking.md) |
| `coding-art` | Software engineering | You are writing, reviewing, refactoring, designing, debugging, or optimizing code and want principled engineering judgment. | [`docs/coding-art.md`](docs/coding-art.md) |

## Installation

Install all skills into the default Agent skills directory:

```bash
scripts/install.sh
```

Install all skills into Codex:

```bash
scripts/install.sh --target codex
```

Install all skills into Claude Code:

```bash
scripts/install.sh --target claude
```

Install one skill only:

```bash
scripts/install.sh --target codex --skill coding-art
```

Install several selected skills:

```bash
scripts/install.sh --target codex --skill beautiful-question --skill coding-art
```

Install into a custom skills directory:

```bash
scripts/install.sh --dest /path/to/skills --all
```

If a destination skill already exists, the installer skips it by default. Add `--force` to replace existing directories:

```bash
scripts/install.sh --target codex --force
```

Preview install actions without copying files:

```bash
scripts/install.sh --target codex --dry-run
```

Default destinations:

| Target | Directory |
| --- | --- |
| `agents` | `~/.agents/skills` |
| `codex` | `~/.codex/skills` |
| `claude` | `~/.claude/skills` |

## Usage

After installation, invoke a skill by its frontmatter name:

```text
Use $coding-art to review this module's design and point out code-quality risks.
```

```text
Use $critical-thinking to examine this view or phenomenon: ...
```

```text
Use $beautiful-question to help me clarify and solve this problem: ...
```

```text
Use $first-principle to rebuild this strategy from first principles: ...
```

```text
Use $deepthink-5so to explore what this phenomenon could ultimately lead to: ...
```

```text
Use $system-thinking to analyze this problem as a system: ...
```

If you are not sure which repository skill to use, start with:

```text
Use $think-router to help me choose the right skill for my problem: ...
```

Chinese prompts work as well:

```text
使用 $think-router 帮我判断这个问题适合用哪个 skill：...
```

## Repository Layout

```text
skills/
  <skill-name>/
    SKILL.md
    references/
    agents/

docs/
  <skill-name>.md

scripts/
  install.sh
```

`skills/` contains installable skill packages. `docs/` contains human-facing documentation for each skill. `scripts/install.sh` copies selected skills into the target agent skills directory.

## Adding A Skill

Recommended structure:

```text
skills/
  your-skill-name/
    SKILL.md
    references/
    agents/
      openai.yaml
```

When adding or changing a skill, update:

- `README.md`
- `README.CN.md`
- `docs/<skill-name>.md`
- `skills/think-router/references/skill-catalog.md`, if the skill should be discoverable through `think-router`

Keep README entries short. Put usage details, scope, and resources in `docs/`.
